Demo library that performs data transfer via webaudio. This is similar to (my understanding of) the way a dial-up modem works. One side encodes ASCII to audio frequencies and plays those frequencies over speakers. The other side receives those frequencies via microphone and decodes back to ASCII.

Possible blog post coming if it works out okay.
